The player starts with 3 lives, indicated by hearts on the screen.

If the player gets 'hurt' a life is lost. The player image blinks for 1 second and the player cannot be hurt during this 1 second.

If all lives are lost, a message is shown that they lost. After 1 second, any key can be pressed to return to the menu.
On this level-over screen, show "Thanks for playing Rainbow Recovery!" and next line smaller "Dedicated to Leo and Benni"

If a level is re-entered, everything is completely reset. Nothing is remembered from the last visit to the level.
