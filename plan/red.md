The red level is 70 x 25 cells with a wall around.

The start is at the left top, and the finish with the red monster at the left bottom.

Player can see the red monster initially, but cannot reach it.

Player has to go all the way to the right to reach red monster.

Red monster (red-monster.png) walks several steps every few seconds, but stays within 15 steps of the bottom left.

The red monster can shoot a round red ball. It only does so if the player is within 20 cells.

The red balls that the red monster shoots disappear if they hit a wall.

It only shoots right, left, up or down, whichever one is closest to player direction.

There are dynamic obstacles.

They move predictably left-right or up-down. They always only turn around when reaching a wall.

If the player touches them, they get pushed out of the way.
