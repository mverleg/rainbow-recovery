# Menu

The main menu has 5 elements on top of each other
* Top: "Recover the colors of the rainbow by fighting monsters"
* A dynamic rainbow, that looks initially gray-like, but colors light up when hovered
  * The arches of the rainbow, from inner to outer, are purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red
* The player character, char-front.png, changes to char-back when hovered
* The monsters, in img/*-monster.png, two lines of 2, same order as the rainbow (red first)
  * The red and blue monsters are scaled up by 20 %
  * When hovered, the monster gets larger. When clicked, the level starts (described elsewhere)
  * Arrow keys can be used to select a monster, which also scales it. Pressing ENTER starts the level.
* At the bottom: "Choose a monster, using the mouse or arrow keys"
* The background is the same grid as in the levels
