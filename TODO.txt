Small fixes to red level:
- Heart symbols should be much bigger, about the same as a cell
- Red monster has disappeared, bring it back
- Blocks are still going halfway into walls before bouncing

Big changes:
Split level.js. Keep all the stuff about collisions, grids, scrolling, etc.
Move all the walls and obstacles, and everything about the red monster, to red.js
