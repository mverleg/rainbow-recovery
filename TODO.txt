Put each level at a separate url, e.g. red level at /red/
Do a page reload during the transition to ensure state is cleared
Move the level-specific js but keep sharing all the rest (main.js, shared.js, level.js, etc)


In the red level, findEmptyNear is undefined
In the menu, the mouse cursor should only be in click mode when hovering a monster
