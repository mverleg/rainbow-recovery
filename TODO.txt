On the main menu, create a rainbow made of 6 arches

Each arch has an individual hover effect - when hovered the color goes from vague to bright

Use the rainbow colors: purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red (red being outer)


Create the first level, red monster

It has a grid like the main page, but scale it up 50% (everywhere including main)

The player character can move on the grid. It always stops on a grid square, but motion is smooth inbetween

When player gets within 40% of an edge, the world scrolls

The player character looks like char-front and is similar size as grid cell, using char-front and front-back for down and up. Use char-right for right, and mirror it for left.

All other monsters should say "level not ready" when selected
