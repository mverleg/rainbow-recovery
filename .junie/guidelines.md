* The game uses Kaplay as engine (replaces Kaboomjs as it is unsupported), use all the features that are useful
* Keep all style and js out of the html file
* Keep several js files, like menu, shared, level and one per color
* If you test something, you can keep the test file around, in tests/ directory
